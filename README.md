# Simple wordcloud app

This application allows users to hit an api endpoint or use a form to add blockers to a DB which is then rendered on the UI.

The more something is added (lets say you enter knowledge) it'll show that as a larger object in the wordcloud.

# Startup

The startup.sh sets up a DB using podman (please change to docker if your prefer this) and also sets up some environment variables.

Wrote this to get used to using nextjs, this is just a learning thing.
